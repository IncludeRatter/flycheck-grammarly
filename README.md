# flycheck-grammarly
> Grammarly support for Flycheck.

## Usage

To enable this package, simply add loading to your config like the code below.

```el
(require 'flycheck-grammarly)
```

If you encounter the performance issue, try raise `flycheck-grammarly-check-time` higher.
The request will be send by this time everytime the buffer has changed.

```el
(setq flycheck-grammarly-check-time 0.8)
```

## Todo List

- [ ] Strip only text data, if other data like `# header` or `> quote` will return nothing.
- [ ] Usable but not fast enough, really depends on Grammarly's analyzer.
